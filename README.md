# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the continuation of noteset_archive app with App Router, RSC and Server Actions. UI not optimize for a Desktop, only check on mobile or Inspect it with a mobile resolution.**

Making this app with an idea to use it in a gym instead of a notebook. Still WIP, plan to ship it soon. In the future might change the logo and add a hero image or a bg design pattern.

## Future updates and plans:

- _Add drag option to rearrange exercises when editing._

- _Finish UI and logic for workout pages._

- _Modify profile and logs page to have an actual content._

- _Add email verification and password reset option, option to delete profile with cascading, uploading profile picture._
