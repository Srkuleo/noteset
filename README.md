# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the same app as noteset_archive, I just switched from T3 to Next.js
template and wanted a clean start with App Router and RSC.**

Making this app with an idea to use it in the gym instead of a notebook. Still WIP, plan
to finish it soon. Developing with intent to only use the app on a mobile device, so
desktop responsiveness is not my priority (still doing something to make it look
bearable).

## Future updates and plans:

- _Change the layout for oAuth buttons on both sign in and sign up page._
- _Migrate from pages to app folder structure, where needed._
- _Set up fetching and db mutation with server actions and RSC._

- _Make new add and edit forms (figure out a way to make modal behave differently on
  animating, using radix ui dialog), add events to buttons (editbar, empty page) and add,
  remove modals._

- _Figure out a way to swipe card with touch._
- _Make start button a link component that leads to new page with workout details._
- _Add an active workout page, with proper structure based on database model._
- _Set a limit on description input field to no longer than 85ch._
