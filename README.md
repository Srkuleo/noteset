# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the continuation of noteset_archive app with App Router, RSC and Server Actions. UI not optimize for a Desktop, only check on mobile or Inspect it with a mobile resolution.**

Making this app with an idea to use it in a gym instead of a notebook. Still WIP, plan to ship it soon. In the future might change the logo and add a hero image or a bg design pattern.

## Future updates and plans:

- _Add warning modal to confirm removing workout and confirming modal to inform user before pushing a new or edited workout to db. Add confirmation pages that confirm workout has been added or edited with revalidation and redirect to users homepage._

- _Figure out data model for db._

- _Finish UI and logic for create and edit pages._

- _Set a limit on description input field to 60ch using zod._

- _Make start button a Link component that leads to workout page with details from that workout, then fetch data from db by reading params from URL._

- _Add an active workout page, with proper structure based on database model._

- _Modify profile and logs page to have an actual content._
