# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the continuation of noteset_archive app with App Router, RSC and Server Actions. UI not optimize for a Desktop, only check on mobile or Inspect it with a mobile resolution.**

Making this app with an idea to use it in a gym instead of a notebook. Still WIP, plan to ship it soon. In the future might change the logo and add a hero image or a bg design pattern.

## Future updates and plans:

- _Finish UI inside add exercise drawer, add option to save exercise, show exercise inside create form, add event listeners to reps and weights inputs and figure out data model for db._

- _Handle and display zod parse errors inside create and edit form._

- _Finish Ui inside preview dialog. Add confirmation page for editting or adding workout that renders if searchParams.editted or searchParams.added is set to "true" with button to redirect to users homepage with revalidated data._

- _Finish UI and logic for create, edit and workout pages._

- _Modify profile and logs page to have an actual content._
