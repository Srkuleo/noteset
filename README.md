# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the same app as noteset_archive, I just switched from T3 to Next.js
template and wanted a clean start with App Router and RSC.**

Making this app with an idea to use it in the gym instead of a notebook. Still WIP, plan
to finish it soon.

Developing with intent to only use on a mobile device, so desktop responsiveness is not my
priority.

## Future updates and plans:

- _Migrate logged in page._
- _Set up next auth and form actions with server actions._
- _Set up fetching and db mutation with server actions._

- _Make new add and edit modal forms using radix ui and server actions for adding a new workout and editing existing one. Add warning modal for removing workout and confirming one before pushing a new or edited workout to db. Add toast notifications using sonner._
- _Set a limit on description input field to no longer than 85ch._

- _Figure out a way to swipe card with touch._
- _Make start button a link component that leads to new page with workout details._
- _Add an active workout page, with proper structure based on database model._
