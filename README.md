# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the continuation of noteset_archive app with App Router, RSC and Server Actions. Initially planned to just be a project to improve App Router knowledge, but started to like the direction it went and decided to ship it fully. UI is not optimized for Desktop devices, since the app should be used mainly inside the gym on the mobile/tablet.**

**_If you are interested in checking functionality or design, please inspect in mobile mode._**

Since I am also interested in mobile dev, I might even make a proper app using React Native instead of Next.js PWA. Going deeper and making the webapp more complex has exposed quite a few shortcomings of PWA.

## Future updates and plans:

- _Refactor dnd and add simple animations with autoanimate to exercises inside edit, creat and post workout page, workouts on home page. Add switch button to choose between archived and current workouts on home page utilizing searchParams._

- _Finish logs page UI - add search and filter option to display workouts with status: done or archived. Make a design similar to Barbers logs._

- _Complete profile UI, add email verification and option to get email from profile page, password reset option, option to delete profile with cascading, uploading profile picture. Add gradient on landing page and make small svg "note your sets". Add option in user preference for padding bottom on navbars._
