# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the continuation of noteset_archive app with App Router, RSC and Server Actions. UI is not optimized for Desktop devices, only check on mobile or Inspect it with a mobile resolution.**

Making this app with the idea to use it in the gym instead of a notebook. Still WIP, plan to ship it soon.

## Future updates and plans:

- _See the way for pending state inside both create and edit form - (found solution with flushSync), fix the layout problem (overscrolling on stateless pages or statefull with overscroll-contain and less UI state than needed to become scrollable, scroll kept after closing keyboard on workout forms, body scrollable without touch-none)._

- _implement form pending state, add animation to theme buttton with translate origin top right and scale._

- _Finish UI and logic for workout pages._

- _Modify profile and logs page to have an actual content._

- _Add email verification and password reset option, option to delete profile with cascading, uploading profile picture._
