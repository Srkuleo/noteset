# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the continuation of noteset_archive app with App Router, RSC and Server Actions. UI not optimize for a Desktop, only check on mobile or Inspect it with a mobile resolution.**

Making this app with an idea to use it in a gym instead of a notebook. Still WIP, plan to ship it soon. In the future might change the logo and add a hero image or a bg design pattern.

## Future updates and plans:

- _Finish Ui inside preview dialog._

- _Handle and display zod parse errors inside the edit form, fix an error with exercises not being provided while editing. Add toast notification for editting workout. Complete UI and logic for whole edit page._

- _Set up own auth flow with Lucia 3.0._

- _Finish UI and logic for workout pages._

- _Modify profile and logs page to have an actual content._
