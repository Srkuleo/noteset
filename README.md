# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the continuation of noteset_archive app with App Router, RSC and Server Actions. UI not optimize for a Desktop, only check on mobile or Inspect it with a mobile resolution.**

Making this app with an idea to use it in a gym instead of a notebook. Still WIP, plan to ship it soon. In the future might change the logo and add a hero image or a bg design pattern.

## Future updates and plans:

- _Try Vaul instead of Radix and finish Ui inside preview dialog. Add confirmation page that renders if searchParam.successful is set to true and redirected to via server action, confirming that workout has been added or edited with revalidation and redirect to users homepage._

- _Handle and display zod parse errors inside create and edit form._

- _Figure out data model for db._

- _Finish UI and logic for create, edit and workout pages._

- _Modify profile and logs page to have an actual content._
