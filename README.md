# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the continuation of noteset_archive app with App Router, RSC and Server Actions. Initially planned to just be a project to improve App Router knowledge, but started to like the direction it went and decided to ship it fully. UI is not optimized for Desktop devices, since the app should be used mainly inside the gym on the mobile/tablet.**

**_If you are interested in checking functionality or design, please inspect in mobile mode._**

Since I am also interested in mobile dev, I might even make a proper app using React Native instead of Next.js PWA. Going deeper and making the webapp more complex has exposed quite a few shortcomings of PWA.

## Future updates and plans:

- _Finish UI and logic for workout and postworkout page. Option to add new exercise if workout is started._

- _Modify profile and logs page to have an actual content._

- _Add email verification and password reset option, option to delete profile with cascading, uploading profile picture._
