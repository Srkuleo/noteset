# NoteSet - my own app for tracking fitness results

**Important: This is the continuation of noteset_archive app with App Router, RSC and Server Actions. UI not optimize for a Desktop, only check on mobile or Inspect it with a mobile resolution.**

Making this app with an idea to use it in a gym instead of a notebook. Still WIP, plan to ship it soon. In the future might change the logo and add a hero image or a bg design pattern.

## Future updates and plans:

- _Put into separate components few stuff from AddExerciseForm and EditExerciseForm for better readability, check EditExerciseForm for potential bugs._

- _Handle and display zod parse errors inside the edit form, fix an error with exercises not being provided while editing._

- _Set up own auth flow with Lucia 3.0._

- _Finish Ui inside preview dialog. Add toast notification for editting workout._

- _Finish UI and logic for edit and workout pages._

- _Modify profile and logs page to have an actual content._
